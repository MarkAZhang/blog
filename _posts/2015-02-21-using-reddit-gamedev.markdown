Feedback Friday is a weekly thread on the [r/gamedev](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev) subreddit where game developers can post their games for constructive criticism. Yesterday, I submitted [Impulse](http://play-impulse.com) for the first time.

At this point, I’ve been working on [Impulse](http://play-impulse.com) on-and-off for the last couple of years while working full-time. I’ve made the classic mistake of focusing on development while neglecting to playtest or market. The great thing about forums like Feedback Friday is that they don’t require a prior online presence or fan following of any kind. I was excited to finally start engaging with the indie community.


### Posting My Game

Here's the description I posted in the thread:

Some thoughts about writing a description:

- Definitely give specific questions you want play-testers to focus on.
- One thing I would change about my description is to position my web link more prominently on a separate line and get rid of 'playable in-browser' which, considering the prevalance of Unity Web Player, wasn't unnecessary.
- My post was on the short side of the spectrum. Some people included a description of their development team, a recent changelog, controls, or even whole press releases. I went through the thread the following day and found that writing more didn't seem to help.

Heres an example of a description I found to be clean and effective:

Listing key features is an efficient way to give player a rundown of your game. The links on the bottom help give a sense of legitimacy (you've got this all set up, right? I still need to post to indieDB. And Greenlight? Maybe one day...) I will definitely be modeling my post after this one in the future.

One last point: I posted my game at 6:00pm in the evening, which means less exposure time. Next time, I'll be posting at midnight sharp.

It was tempting to stop here and hope for the best, but that felt like a missed opportunity. The Feedback Friday thread was in ‘contest mode’, meaning posts were always shown in a random order. If I took no further action, I would be relying on random chance to get feedback for my game. I didn't like that.

### Going Through the Thread

After posting my game, the next thing I did was look for games to playtest. I had a hypothesis that if I gave good, helpful feedback, developers would be willing to look at my game in return. In essence, the amount of feedback and exposure my game received would be directly tied to the amount of time I put into helping others. It was an idealistic notion. Classic reciprocation. I was curious if it would work.

When deciding which games to play, I primarily looked at *how many comments the game had already received*. I preferred to look at games with little or no feedback. In this way, I gave help to developers who needed it most. I also thought there was a higher chance the developer would help me in return.

### Giving Feedback to Other Games
There a lot of articles on giving good feedback, so I’ll just offer some tips that I found helpful:

- **Read the developer instructions.** Make note of what feedback they’re looking for. Don’t waste your time playing parts of the game that aren’t ready. For one game, the dev asked only for testers with controllers. I missed that and spent five minutes trying to figure out how to play the game with a keyboard.
- **Give the game a serious chance.** Aim to spend at least 15 minutes playing each game. If you don’t understand the controls initially, keep trying. If something doesn’t work, try to work around it. If the game, god forbid, turns out to be fun, keep playing it. Developers will appreciate the attention you gave to their game.
- **Take detailed notes.** Parts of the UI you disliked. Controls or gameplay elements that confused you. Level design that frustrated you. It's all gold to the developer. Remember that in an ideal play-testing scenario, you and the dev would be in the same room, and they would be able to watch your emotions, the mistakes you make, your thinking process, etc. Since this isn’t possible, you’ll have to make up for it by being thorough and attentive.
- **Be constructive, not critical.** Your goal is to help them, not make them feel bad.

An hour into this process, I realized that I was having fun! Considering that I love playing games and thinking about game design and UX, I guess this isn't surprising.

### Ask Nicely for Feedback in Return

At the end of each of my responses, I added:

```Hope this was helpful! If you have some spare time, my game Impulse is also on this thread, and I’d love to get your feedback.```

Looking back, there's beauty in this set-up. I'm incentivized to write the highest quality feedback I can, in the hope that the developer I'm helping, out of gratitude, will look at my game carefully in return. This relies on the assumption that indie game developers are generally nice people, a fact I wholeheartedly believe.

Furthermore, this approach is hard to abuse, because developers can always choose to ignore people they feel are being spammy or insincere. The driving force behind this interaction is sincere, helpful feedback, and I'd have no qualms about recommending everyone to try it out.

Even when I didn't get a response, playing other developers' games and looking at them critically was a great learning opportunity and a chance to see what other people were doing. This in itself made it all worthwhile.

### The Results

I gave feedback to four games this first Feedback Friday. One of them was the guy who was only looking for controller testers, and I didn’t ask him for feedback because my reply wasn’t very helpful. To my delight, the other three *all got back to me* in one form or another.

The quality of the feedback varied, but the creator of Space Battle’s feedback about the initial difficulty curve was very helpful in particular.

I should note that, probably due to my late submission time, I didn't receive any other feedback other than from the developers I helped. Had I just stopped after submitting, my game would have received no feedback.

### Summary

To have a good time at Feedback Friday, follow these steps:

- Post your game with a succinct description and specific playtesting questions.
- Play other people's games and give them high-quality feedback.
- Request feedback in return.
- ???
- Profit.

Feedback Friday definitely takes a time commitment, but the best part is that your payout is proportional to your efforts. As a gamer, I love it when things work out that way. I’m looking forward to participating again next Friday. Hope I'll see you there!
